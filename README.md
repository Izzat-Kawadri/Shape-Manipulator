This project is a computer graphics assignment implemented using Unity3D. It allows users to draw, manipulate (rotate, scale, translate), and interact with various 2D and 3D shapes. The project consists of two main scenes and provides both keyboard input and button-based interactions for a seamless user experience.

## Features

### 1. Load Scene
- This is the introductory scene where the appâ€™s guidelines and instructions are displayed.
- **Start Button**: Click this button to move to the main scene.

### 2. Main Scene
- The main scene allows users to draw shapes and perform various transformations on them.
  
#### Available Shapes:
- **Press '1'** to Draw a **Circle**
- **Press '2'** to Draw a **3D Cube**
- **Press '3'** to Draw a **Triangle**
- **Press '4'** to Draw a **Ball**
- **Press '5'** to Draw a **Square**
- **Press '6'** to Draw a **Polygon**

#### Available Operations:

- **Press 'S'** to **Scale** the shape.
- **Press 'T'** to **Translate** the shape.

#### Additional Features:
- **Left-click** on any shape to display its position in 3D space.
- **Click on any shape** to bring up a list of **color buttons** (circular buttons) that allow you to change the color of the selected shape.
- **Press 'i'** to take a screenshot of the current scene.

#### Additional Buttons:
